Hello! Welcome to a brand new version of _Frogger_! First let me introduce the
**rules of the game**:
1. There are 5 players, you need to send them all to the other side of the river
to win the game!
2. Each of them has 2 lives, be careful not to collapse with the bugs, which
will let the player lose one life!
4. Grab a star to gain an extra life which could be inherited to the next
player.
5. Every player should grab a gem to cross the river! I know that sounds
ridiculous, but I made it as a rule to accomplish more complicated game.

And here's how you **can play the game**:
1. The game is started as the page loaded, so you can begin playing as you see
the game on the screen.
2. Use arrow keys to move the player.

Here's what doesn't show in this version but I **plan to do next**:
1. A reset button to start a new game.

I've done my part to make the game more interesting, so hope you find it
interesting too.
